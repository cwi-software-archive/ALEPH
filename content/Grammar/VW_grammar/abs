.ab
A W-grammar (2-level grammar) of the programming language ALEPH is
presented. It comprises the context-free grammar as published before
plus all static restrictions. Some comment is given on the problems
encountered in writing and debugging a W-grammar. This paper
should be read in parallel with the ALEPH Manual, since it by itself
does not define or explain the language.
