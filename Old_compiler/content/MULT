* WE USE THE FXX*X AND DXX*X INSTRUCTIONS OF THE MULTIPLICATION UNIT,
* WHICH GENERALLY DO WHAT WE WANT, EXCEPT IN ONE CASE:
* IF A 'GE' 2**47 & B 'GE' 2**47  & A*B 'LT' 2**95 THEN
* THE RESULT IS YIELDED WITH A LEFT SHIFT OF ONE, DUE TO NORMALIZATION
* CONVENTIONS. THIS SITUATION IS DETECTED UPON UNPACKING THE LOWER (D)
* PRODUCT: THE EXPONENT WILL BE  1  RATHER THAN  0. A TWO-REGISTER
* RIGHT SHIFT IS EXECUTED THEN.
