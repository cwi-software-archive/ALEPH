*
* 'SETRANDOM' MAY NEVER MAKE 'R.WORD' ZERO. FURTHERMORE, SINCE THE
* BIT-SHUFFLER BEHAVES BADLY FOR STARTING VALUES THAT
* CONTAIN VERY FEW ONES, AND SINCE THE USER WILL GENERALLY
* SPECIFY SMALL VALUES, WE HAVE TO ADD ONES, WITHOUT OBSCURING
* HIS INFORMATION. THESE CONSIDERATIONS LEAD TO THE FOLLOWING:
*
          SX6    323362B     JUST A BIT-PATTERN, 18 BITS
          SB5    X6+B1       AND MORE SO
          LX1    30          GIVE USER'S INFO DIRECT INFLUENCE
          IX6    X6+X1       ADD USER'S INFORMATION
          PX6    X6,B5       ADD ONES, MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE X6 IS NOT 0
          SA6    =XR.WORD    STORE NEW BITS
          EQ     SET3DOM
